This program sends the user an alert on What's App to let them know it's going to rain.

The program utilizes the https://openweathermap.org API and more specifically the 5 day / 3 hour forecast data API to check if it's going to rain in the next hours.
I also use the https://www.twilio.com/en-us API to send an alert in the user's What's App number.
